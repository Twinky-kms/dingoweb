        <p>
          Dingocoin is a community-driven open-source project and its direction
          is formed by the many contributors to the various projects of the
          Dingocoin blockchain and ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dingocoin is inviting all to contribute to its development. Head over
          to{" "}

            How to get involved?
          </a>{" "}
          if you want to be one of our guardians. The direction of Dingocoin is
          created by the many projects that the community chooses to undertake.
          From a fair launch, guardians choose to come along and strive to
          continue creating happiness every day, the Dingocoin way. Dingocoin
          remains a decentralised project with guardians rather than rulers,
          each whose projects and contributions stand or fall on their merits.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Trailmap represents places where the Dingocoin community have
          promised the Dingo, our apex predator, we are committed to explore,
          and that we believe will contribute to Dingocoin’s success.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-4">WHY THESE PROJECTS?</h4>
        <p>
          We signed the Dingocoin Manifesto, committing to spreading happiness
          every day. Our community knows no boundaries, and we believe opening
          up to all humans in every language is our essential first step to
          spreading happiness everywhere. We appreciate that this first step
          will consist of many small steps, and we welcome all contributors,
          from all places, across all of humanity to become part of our
          community.
        </p>

          The easiest-use wallet in existence is another brave step to destroy
          boundaries in the adoption of Dingocoin. Our non-custodial browser
          wallet is a one-click installation (

          Game integration with Roblox has been completed, and you can hold and
          play with Dingocoins in Dingo Coin City. We believe integration with
          games is essential for adoption, and we promote further development
          and integration with games. The meme and art community surrounding
          Dingocoin is strong, and our NFT platform will further add to the
          strength of this community while adding additional utility to
          Dingocoin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our foundational initiatives to ease integration of Dingocoin with
          anything else consists of the Dingocoin NextGen framework, Libraries,
          SDKs and APIs. Dingocoin NextGen framework, Libraries, SDKs and APIs
          opens up new oppurtunities for payment providers, retailers, NFT
          artists, Game developers, Social Platforms and many more for quick
          integration of Dingocoin into their infrastructure through scalable
          backend solutions. A proposed Dingocoin Keyring App and Sdk will
          ensure rapid developments of apps that can transact over the chain
          using webwallet API and without holding user keys – a completely
          trustless model.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-4">THE COMMUNITY JOURNEY</h4>
        <p>
          Since Dingocoin is community led from Day 1 and each of its features
          evolved during this journey is the contribution and efforts of
          individual community members in building this ecosystem, we are proud
          to present the Trailmap of Dingocoin to you which will help in
          navigating all projects going on. It will also be useful to welcome
          new devs and contributors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Trailmap is effort of Dingocoin community in making this coin a
          real utility vehicle for different ascpects. Unlike what is the case
          for countless minted tokens, the community is completely dedicated
          from the beginning in building useful products for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in adoption of this very universal currency through utility
          only. Dingocoin is completely decentralized and is already adopted by
          many different members from different geographies.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-4">WHEN WILL IT ALL HAPPEN</h4>
        <p>
          The timeline working on such an adventure is not easy task, but the
          first steps have been taken for all of our community projects, and we
          welcome contributors to help us fulfill our vision. We already have
          powerful allies on our side, as well as a growing number of people
          eager to contribute development time to these open-source projects.
